          <p>
            I want to free women from pressure, unnecessary rules and show them
            how they can live a healthy life while enjoying delicious food that
            does not require any special preparation or special ingredients that
            you do not already use. Changing habits and ways of thinking about
            food is an important segment of my work with clients where we
            nurture compassion, tenderness and self-care instead of condemnation
            and self-harassment that is often mixed with self-discipline today.
